/**
 * Cloudflare Workers entry point.
 *
 * This exists because the backend no longer holds anything in memory between
 * requests. The old design parked a promise in a Map and waited for a webhook to
 * resolve it, which only works if exactly one process handles both — hence a
 * rented, always-on box. Dispatch state now lives in D1, so any invocation can
 * carry any call forward and the box is unnecessary.
 *
 * Two things still cannot come from process.env:
 *   - D1 is a binding (env.DB), handed to us per-request.
 *   - Everything else (VAPI keys, Gemini, the webhook secret) IS on process.env,
 *     via nodejs_compat + nodejs_compat_populate_process_env, which is why
 *     config.ts's module-scoped ENV and its ten readers survived the port.
