 *   - Outbound call: POST https://api.vapi.ai/call
 *       { phoneNumberId, customer: { number }, assistant: {...transient...} }
 *     Response: { id, ... } — `id` is the call id we correlate on.
 *   - Webhook (server messages): { message: { type: 'end-of-call-report',
 *       endedReason, call: { id }, artifact: { transcript, messages } } }
 *
 * startCall places the call and returns its id, nothing more. The outcome comes
 * back at the webhook and is correlated through the persisted CallRecord — see
 * dispatchMachine. This file holds no cross-request state, which is what lets
 * the backend run on a serverless runtime at all.

 *   - transcript feeds the live captions on the stage dashboard.

 * narrowing existed to stop status-update/speech-update chatter. Once live
 * captions were built, that omission meant the dashboard could only ever show

 * stayed silent. inbound.ts had it right; this did not. Keep the two lists in
