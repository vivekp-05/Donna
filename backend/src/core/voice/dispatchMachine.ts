/**
 * The dispatch state machine — the event-driven replacement for caller.ts's
 * blocking loop.
 *
 * The old shape was one long-lived `for` loop with `await placeCall()` in the
 * middle, and a promise parked in an in-memory Map that only the webhook could
 * resolve. That is the single reason the backend needed to be one process that
 * never restarts: a promise in instance A's RAM is invisible to instance B, so
 * a webhook landing on the wrong instance resolved nothing.
 *
 * Same logic, no stack:
 *
 *   approve            → rank item 0, persist shortlist, place call #1, RETURN
 *   report(accepted)   → matched, credit ledger, advance to the next item
 *   report(declined)   → candidateIndex++, place the next call
 *   report, exhausted  → unplaceable, advance to the next item
 *   no items left      → Agent 5 donor callback, donation resolved
 *
 * Every transition reads its state from the store and writes it back, so any
 * invocation on any machine can carry the work forward.
 *
 * Items go strictly one at a time (`donation.itemCursor`). Firing them in
 * parallel would be free here, but LIVE_CALL_PHONE_OVERRIDE points every call
 * at one handset — parallel dispatch would ring the demo phone three times at
 * once.
